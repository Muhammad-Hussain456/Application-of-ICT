💻 Introduction to ICT (Information and Communication Technology)

🖥️ What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic machine that receives data, processes it into useful information, stores it, and produces output.
It follows a set of instructions called a program.
👉 Example: Calculating marks, creating documents, or sending emails.



🔹 Data, Information, and Knowledge
📊 Data – Raw facts and figures (e.g., 82, 95, 76)
📈 Information – Processed data that has meaning (e.g., Average = 84)
🧠 Knowledge – Understanding based on information (e.g., The student needs to improve)

➡️ Data → Information → Knowledge



⚙️ What is Computing?
Computing means using computers to process, manage, and communicate data efficiently.
It includes input, processing, storage, and output.
💬 In short: “Using computers to work with information.”



📡 What is Communication?
Communication is the exchange of information between two or more people or devices.
It can be verbal (spoken), non-verbal (gestures), or digital (emails, messages).
