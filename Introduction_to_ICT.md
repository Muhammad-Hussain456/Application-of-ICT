## üíª What is a Computer?

A **computer** is an **electronic device** that:

- **Receives** data  
- **Processes** it into meaningful information  
- **Outputs** the results  
- **Stores** data for future use  

It performs these actions by executing a set of instructions known as a **program**.

## üîπ Data vs Information

| Term | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Data** | Raw, unprocessed facts and figures without context | `85`, `A`, `12345` |
| **Information** | Processed, organized, or structured data that is meaningful and useful | `Student scored 85 marks` |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Four Basic Operations of a Computer

1. **Receives input data**  
2. **Processes the data**  
3. **Stores data or results**  
4. **Generates output information**

## üß© Main Components of a Computer

### üñ•Ô∏è Hardware
**Hardware** refers to the **physical components** of a computer that you can see and touch.

**Examples:**
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Memory (RAM)
- Storage Devices (Hard Drive, SSD)
- Input Devices (Keyboard, Mouse)
- Output Devices (Monitor, Printer)

### üß† Software
**Software** is a **set of instructions or programs** that tell the hardware what to do.  
It controls and coordinates all hardware components to perform tasks.

**Types of Software:**
1. **System Software** ‚Äì Controls and manages hardware (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
2. **Application Software** ‚Äì Helps users perform specific tasks (e.g., MS Word, Web Browser)

## üåê Networking and Connectivity

When multiple computers are connected together, they form a **Network**, which allows:
- **Communication**
- **File Sharing**
- **Resource Sharing** (like printers or storage)

Multiple networks combine to form the **Internet**, a global system of interconnected computers.
