## 🔹 Functions of a Computer

A computer performs four main functions (also called IPO cycle):

1️⃣ **Input:** Taking data from the user.  
2️⃣ **Processing:** Working on data to make it meaningful.  
3️⃣ **Storage:** Saving data for future use.  
4️⃣ **Output:** Showing or printing the result.

👉 **Example:**  
Typing marks (**input**) → Calculating total (**processing**) → Saving file (**storage**) → Showing result (**output**)
