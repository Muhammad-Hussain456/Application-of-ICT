💻 Computer Fundamentals


⚙️ Characteristics of a Computer

🧠 1️⃣ Speed: Computers process data very fast.
2️⃣ Accuracy: They perform tasks with high accuracy.
3️⃣ Storage: Can store a large amount of data.
4️⃣ Versatility: Can perform many types of tasks.
5️⃣ Diligence: Never get tired or bored.
6️⃣ Automation: Work automatically after giving instructions.
7️⃣ Connectivity: Can connect with other computers and devices.


🔹 Functions of a Computer

A computer performs four main functions/operations:

1️⃣ Input: Taking data from the user.
2️⃣ Processing: Working on data to make it meaningful.
3️⃣ Storage: Saving data for future use.
4️⃣ Output: Showing or printing the result.

👉 Example:
Typing marks (input) → Calculating total (processing) → Saving file (storage) → Showing result (output).



📏 Classification/Types of Computers (By Purpose & Size)

🎯 By Purpose:

General-purpose: Used for everyday work (e.g., PC, Laptop)

Special-purpose: Made for a specific task (e.g., ATM machine, Flight Control System)

📦 By Size:

1️⃣ Microcomputer:
Smallest type, used by one person.
👉 Example: PC, Laptop, Tablet

2️⃣ Minicomputer:
Used by small organizations for shared tasks.
👉 Example: DEC PDP, IBM AS/400

3️⃣ Mainframe Computer:
Used by large companies for big data processing.
👉 Example: IBM zSeries

4️⃣ Supercomputer:
Most powerful and fastest; used for scientific research.
👉 Example: Summit, Fugaku
